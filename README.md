**Hey, I’m Mohit Deharkar**    

A Chemical Engineering student at **IIT Jodhpur**, but my true passion lies in the world of tech , robotics 🤖, and programming 
. Python , C and ROS 🤖 are the languages my brain speaks fluently.   
When I’m not cracking💡 C or Python, I’m out exploring the 
realms of AI 🧠 and robotics ⚙️, all while making things work in the most innovative ways.  

**Here’s the deal**

My ❤️ beats for tech, and you'll often find me immersed in robotics and automation ⚙️. I’m all about creating, innovating, and collaborating to turn ideas into reality.  
Technology is my playground, and I'm driven to leave a legacy in the world of tech.

**Let's create some 🪄***Magic***✨**

Let’s create something awesome! If you’re into open-source, robotics, or AI-powered projects, we should definitely connect! 🚀
